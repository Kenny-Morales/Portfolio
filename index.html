            <h1>Who</h1>
            <p>I'm fascinated by the inner workings of the systems that shape our daily lives. In my free time, I like to play pickup basketball, watch entertaining YouTube videos, and stay up-to-date with technology trends and advancements. If I had to describe myself in one word, I would choose "iridescent," because I am multifaceted, constantly changing, and always seeking to discover new things.</p>
            <h1>Where</h1>
            <p>Growing up in Grand Island, Nebraska, I learned the value of resilience and determination. Despite facing challenges when my mom was deported and I had to move in with my aunt, I adapted and persevered. This experience taught me to overcome unexpected obstacles and instilled in me a determination to succeed. Today, I am optimistic about the future and excited to see where my journey takes me.</p>
            <h1>When</h1>
            <p>Last year, I discovered my passion for coding while designing a self-stirring water bottle. Despite learning Java a year prior and finding it boring, I was immersed in the experience of coding this time around. I realized how much I enjoyed being creative and how gratifying design could be. Since then, I've been amazed by the endless possibilities and limitations that coding offers. Each new project is like a blank canvas, waiting for me to create something beautiful with my code. My passion for coding and design continues to grow with each project, and I am excited to see where it will take me in the future. </p>

                <h1>Who</h1>
                <p>I'm fascinated by the inner workings of the systems that shape our daily lives. In my free
                    time, I like to play pickup basketball, watch entertaining YouTube videos, and stay up-to-date with
                    technology trends and advancements. If I had to describe myself in one word, I would choose
                    "iridescent," because I am multifaceted, constantly changing, and always seeking to discover new
                    things.

            <div>
                <h1>What</h1>
                <p>Growing up in Grand Island, Nebraska, I learned the value of resilience and determination.
                    Despite facing challenges when my mom was deported and I had to move in with my aunt, I adapted and
                    persevered. This experience taught me to overcome unexpected obstacles and instilled in me a
                    determination to succeed. Today, I am optimistic about the future and excited to see where my
                    journey
                    takes me.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>When</h1>
                <p>Last year, I discovered my passion for coding while designing a self-stirring water
                    bottle. Despite learning Java a year prior and finding it boring, I was immersed in the experience
                    of
                    coding this time around. I realized how much I enjoyed being creative and how gratifying design
                    could
                    be. Since then, I've been amazed by the endless possibilities and limitations that coding offers.
                    Each
                    new project is like a blank canvas, waiting for me to create something beautiful with my code. My
                    passion for coding and design continues to grow with each project, and I am excited to see where it
                    will
                    take me in the future. </p>
